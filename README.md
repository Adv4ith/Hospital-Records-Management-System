# Hospital-Records-Management-System
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are usually controlled by hospitals, limiting patient access and complicating care across different providers. Blockchain technology offers a solution by allowing patients secure, immutable access to their own medical data, independent of hospitals. This paper introduces an attribute-based signature scheme using multiple authorities, enabling patients to verify their information without revealing personal details. Unlike traditional systems, thereâ€™s no central authority, which enhances security and aligns with blockchain's decentralized storage. The method also protects against collusion attacks and ensures data integrity, outperforming other models in both security and efficiency.
